# CLAUDE.md ‚Äì Rift Worldbuilding Context

## üå™ Overview
The **Rift** is a vast corridor of space where **gravitational shear pulls planetary atmospheres outward**, forming colossal **storm-rivers** of air, vapor, and plasma that flow between worlds. These rivers glow with lightning arcs, making the Rift a storm-laced network of luminous veins in the void.

## Environment
- **Storm-Rivers**: Miles-wide torrents of atmosphere, navigable like cosmic oceans. Charged with lightning and unstable crosscurrents.
- **The Drift**: Chaotic eddies at the Rift‚Äôs edges, swallowing ships into turbulence or scattering them into deep space.
- **Planets**: Worlds bleed their skies into the Rift, ecosystems adapt to half-void conditions with unique flora and fauna.

## Civilization
- **Skyships**: Hybrid sail-and-crystal craft designed to tack through the atmospheric torrents, often relying on intuition as much as science.
- **Trade Hubs**: Floating cities and beacon stations at storm confluences, where currents meet and commerce flourishes.
- **Commerce**: Key goods include crystallized lightning batteries, exotic gases, and Rift-grown biota with unusual properties.

## Culture & Belief
- Storm-rivers are seen as **living currents** or divine arteries connecting worlds.
- Pilgrimages follow the rivers ‚Äúupstream‚Äù to source-worlds, believed to be sacred.
- Navigators act as both pilots and priests, interpreting storm patterns as charts and omens.
- Beacons maintain stability in dangerous zones; keepers are revered figures of solitude and resilience.

## Themes
- **Connectivity vs. Fragility**: The Rift naturally links planets, but extraction or misuse can destabilize the currents.
- **Faith vs. Physics**: Debate over whether the Rift is a natural anomaly or intentional cosmic design.
- **Balance vs. Exploitation**: Harnessing storms provides immense power but risks unraveling entire atmospheres.

## Story Hooks
- A beacon keeper guiding ships through The Drift, journaling storm moods and near-disasters.
- Merchant convoys risking collapse for profit, singing river-songs as they sail.
- A culture that believes the Rift itself remembers every passage, every voice shouted into its storms.
- Scientists seeking to stabilize storm-rivers for colonization ‚Äî opposed by navigators who see this as sacrilege.

‚ö° The Rift is a **cosmic storm-ocean**, where civilizations sail atmosphere between worlds, surviving on fragile beacons, storm-prayers, and the courage to ride the currents.
