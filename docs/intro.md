# The Tempest Rift

> *"Where atmospheres become oceans, and storms forge the paths between worlds."*

Welcome to the **Tempest Rift** — a vast corridor of space where gravitational anomalies have torn planetary atmospheres free, creating luminous storm-rivers that flow between worlds. This is a universe where skyships sail through cosmic tempests, lighthouse keepers guide vessels through the void, and civilizations thrive on the fragile balance between connectivity and chaos.

## What is the Tempest Rift?

The Rift is not merely empty space — it is a living network of atmospheric torrents, each one a miles-wide river of air, vapor, and plasma bleeding from the worlds it connects. These storm-rivers glow with perpetual lightning, creating a web of light across the darkness that can be seen from planetary surfaces as veins of fire in the night sky.

## A Universe of Possibilities

Within this wiki, you'll discover:

- **Worlds** half-stripped of their skies, where life adapts to the edge of vacuum
- **Skyships** that navigate by storm-song and crystal resonance
- **Cultures** that worship the rivers as divine arteries
- **Technologies** powered by crystallized lightning and captured tempests
- **Mysteries** of the Rift's origin and its true nature

## Begin Your Journey

Whether you're a navigator plotting courses through the storm-rivers, a merchant seeking fortune in the floating trade hubs, or a keeper maintaining the beacons that hold back The Drift, the Tempest Rift awaits your exploration.

⚡ *The storms remember. The rivers know. And every passage leaves its mark upon the currents.*
