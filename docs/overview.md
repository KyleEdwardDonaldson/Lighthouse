# Overview of the Tempest Rift

## The Great Anomaly

The Tempest Rift defies conventional understanding of space. Where void should reign, atmospheric rivers flow. Where silence should prevail, storms rage eternal. This cosmic anomaly spans thousands of light-years, connecting hundreds of worlds through its network of luminous torrents.

## The Nature of the Rift

### Gravitational Shear
The Rift exists in a region where gravitational forces have torn the fabric of normal space-time. These tears create:
- **Atmospheric Bleeding**: Planetary atmospheres are pulled outward in continuous streams
- **Storm Formation**: The mixing of different atmospheric compositions creates perpetual tempests
- **Lightning Networks**: Electrical discharge between different pressure zones creates navigable paths

### The Living Current
Many believe the Rift possesses a form of consciousness or memory:
- Storm patterns respond to regular traffic
- Certain routes "remember" frequent passages
- The rivers seem to favor some vessels over others
- Weather moods shift in response to major events

## Scale and Scope

### Physical Dimensions
- **Length**: Approximately 3,000 light-years at its longest measurable point
- **Width**: Varies from 50 to 500 light-years
- **Storm-River Diameter**: Individual rivers range from 10 to 1,000 miles wide
- **Current Speed**: Atmospheric flows move at 100-10,000 mph depending on conditions

### Connected Worlds
The Rift touches approximately 347 documented planets:
- **Core Worlds**: 12 major civilizations at strategic confluences
- **Rim Worlds**: Dozens of colonies clinging to the Rift's edges
- **Lost Worlds**: Planets consumed entirely by The Drift
- **Source Worlds**: Ancient planets believed to be the Rift's origin points

## The Great Mystery

No one knows how the Tempest Rift formed. Theories range from:
- A natural cosmic catastrophe
- An ancient civilization's failed experiment
- A divine creation to connect scattered worlds
- A wound in reality that refuses to heal

What is certain: the Rift has existed for at least ten thousand years, based on the oldest navigation songs and lighthouse records. And it shows no signs of closing.
